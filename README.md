###📱 Machine Components:                                                                                                                                                                                     
   ####Our cleaning machine is composed of several innovative components that contribute to its efficiency and functionality:                                                                              

  🔹Sweeping Roller: A motor-driven roller rotates opposite to the machine’s movement, efficiently sweeping debris into the garbage collector.  
  🔹Mopping Roller: Dispenses water from the top-mounted tank and evenly mops the floor, ensuring thorough cleaning.  
  🔹Wiping Disk: Rotates to dry the floor after mopping, leaving it clean and dry.  
  🔹Drying Fan: Accelerates the drying process by providing additional air circulation.  
  🔹Water Tank: Stores water to supply the mopping system for wet cleaning.  
  🔹Sensors: Detect obstacles and prevent collisions, ensuring smooth navigation and safety during operation.  
  🔹Garbage Collector: Captures debris collected by the sweeping roller, maintaining cleanliness throughout the operation.

###⚙️ Operational Mechanism:

  1. Sweeping: The front-mounted sweeping roller picks up debris and directs it into the garbage collector.  
  2. Mopping: Water from the tank is dispensed onto the floor via the mopping roller, ensuring even moisture distribution.  
  3. Drying: The wiping disk, along with the drying fan, ensures that the floor is left dry and spotless after mopping.

###💻 Conclusion:
