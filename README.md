# floorCleaningMachine
🚀 Exciting Project Milestone! 🚀

I am thrilled to share the successful completion of our laboratory floor-cleaning machine project, developed as part of the Design and Prototyping (ID3020) course! 🧼🤖

Our R3 team put in extensive effort to bring this innovative solution to life, blending functionality with sustainability. Here’s what makes our project stand out:

Key Features:
🧹 Efficient Cleaning: A high-speed rotating roller efficiently collects debris into an integrated garbage collector. Sweeps a 5 m² area in just 30 seconds using a high-speed rotating sweeping roller.

💧 Versatile Floor Care: A sponge system effectively absorbs spilled liquids. A water pump with a dropping mechanism wets the floor, followed by a mopping roller and rotating mopping disks for thorough cleaning. The process is completed with cooling fans that ensure rapid drying.

🌍 Eco-Friendly Design: Built with recyclable/reusable materials and scavenged components, powered by mostly renewable energy sources.

📱 Smart Control: Operated through a Bluetooth-enabled mobile app, ensuring ease of use and remote control capabilities.

⚙️ Technical Details:
Compact & Lightweight: Less than 100 cm³ in size and weighs under 20 kg.
Environmentally Conscious: Prioritizes sustainability without compromising performance.

💻 This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply my skills in Arduino programming, mobile app development, and sustainable engineering. I’m proud of our team’s achievement and excited about the potential impact of this machine.
